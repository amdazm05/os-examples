Named pipes are similar to named Unix Domain Sockets, also called 'local' socket
	Network sockets allow IPC between different hosts/ different machines
Example 
	- FIFO reader/writer
	- 2 processes as mentioned here
	- writer will send rando
	- reader will read it until of file
	- read, write io is the same in C IO/API is the same
